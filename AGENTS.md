# AGENTS.md — Workspace Guidance for Exam Prepare Site

## Workspace Identity

`Exam_prepare_site` is a local-running web application designed for practicing, reviewing, and analyzing medical specialization exam questions (TSN 腎臟專科醫師甄試與歷年交換題).

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Lupin/Codex**: Primary workspace developer and repository structure maintainer.
- **Tonks/Antigravity**: Supportive partner and reviewer agent. Manages quality verification, review memos, and skill workflows.

## Single Source of Truth (SSOT) Data Sources

1. **Processed Exam Questions**:
   - Location: `/Users/yuan/Projects/Exam/Exam_prepare_database/Processed`
   - Description: Mineru-processed test papers and exchange questions. Paper folders ending in `- 原檔` must be stripped for display.

2. **Reference Image Outputs**:
   - KDIGO Guidelines: `/Users/yuan/Projects/PDF/Outputs/KDIGO`
   - Brenner 11e: `/Users/yuan/Projects/PDF/Outputs/2020 Brenner 11e`
   - Note: Other image folders in `PDF/Outputs` are not cited by NotebookLM and must be ignored.

3. **NotebookLM Dual Asking Gateway**:
   - Skill: `/tn-nlm-asking-mcqs`
   - Directory: `/Users/yuan/Projects/Notebooklm/NLM_MCQs`
   - Gateway Command: `uv run --directory /Users/yuan/Projects/Notebooklm/NLM_MCQs python -m MCQ_manufacturer.nlm_asking_gateway`
   - Architecture: 25-Worker pool across 5 accounts / 25 Notebooks.

## Web Application Architecture

- **Framework**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Vanilla CSS / Tailwind.
- **Data Location**: `public/server-data/`
  - `exams_manifest.json`: List of all imported test papers.
  - `<paper_id>.json`: Structured question bank for individual paper.
  - `image_index.json`: Citation mapping for KDIGO and Brenner 11e figures.
- **Modes**:
  - `Practice Mode` (正計時, no countdown, submit all to reveal answers).
  - `Dispute Analysis` (Highlights discrepancies between source provided answer and dual NotebookLM responses).

## Key Skills

- `/tn-exam-prepare`: Ingestion skill for scanning question directories, requesting Yuan confirmation, dispatching dual NLM asking via `/tn-nlm-asking-mcqs`, matching images, and updating the web database.
